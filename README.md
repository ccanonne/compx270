# COMPx270: "Randomised and Advanced algorithms"
Lecture notes for the class developed for the University of Sydney. Each chapter is the basis for a two-hour lecture, and the class is aimed at last-year undergrads and masters of computer science students, without required previous exposure to advanced algorithms. It is not, by design, meant to be comprehensive. Some very nice algorithms will be missing; many important ideas may not make the cut.
